# HorseGeneAnnotation
Welcome! This is the README file for HorseGeneAnnotation: a manually curated,
crowd-sourced gene annotation website for the horse. This repo contains all of

# To study genomics you need a genome
Genetics studies how changes in DNA changes can affect a living organism. Similarly,
genomics investigates the entirety of an organisms DNA-sequence -- its genome. Since
everyone, except twins and clones, have a different genome, it can be hard to 
organize experiments. Researchers studying genetics and genomics collectively
rely on a reference genome in order to make comparisons. This way, when a scientist
finds what they think is a change, or a mutation, they can compare it to the reference 
genome in order to design experiments. 

Generating a reference genome costs a lot of money.
