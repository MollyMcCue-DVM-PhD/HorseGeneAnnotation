# HorseGeneAnnotation
Welcome! This is the README file for HorseGeneAnnotation: a manually curated,
crowd-sourced gene annotation website for the horse. This repo contains all of
the source code, documentations, tutorials and project tracking for
HorseGeneAnnotation.

## To study genomics you need a genome
Genetics studies how changes in DNA changes can affect a living organism. Similarly,
genomics investigates the entirety of an organisms DNA-sequence -- its genome. Since
everyone, except twins and clones, have a different genome, it can be hard to 
organize experiments. Researchers studying genetics and genomics collectively
rely on a reference genome in order to make comparisons. This way, when a scientist
finds what they think is a change in the DNA, or a mutation, they can compare it to the reference 
genome in order to design experiments. 

Generating a reference genome costs a lot of money -- but it is getting better. 
The cost to sequence the first human genome was nearly 3 billion<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>
dollars! Due to rapid advances in technology and an emerging biomedical market,
a genome today only takes ~$1000 dollars to sequence<sup>[2](#ref2)</sup>. This is a pretty
good deal considering that the human genome is composed of nearly 3.2 billion
base pairs, the unit of information in DNA<sup>[3](#ref3)</sup>. This advance in technology
has also enabled reasearchers and scientists who study other genetics in other
organisms to draft and assemble their own genome. In 2009, less than a decade 
after the human genome was completed, the nearly 2.7 billion base pairs of the 
equine genome were sequenced and made available to the public[4](#ref4).

## A finished reference genome isn't done
A genome is **massive**. If you printed yours out on paper, it would fill a book
case. It almost unbelievable that almost every cell in your body contains a full
copy of your DNA. And as you can imagine, despite our best attempts, while fully sequencing
a genome, errors were introduced. Imagine that even if scientists were 99.999% accurate 
while assembling a genome, and the genome you were assembling was 3 billion base
pairs, you'd still end up with approximately 3 million errors introduced in your reference!

There were thousands of people<sup>[5](#5)</sup> working in the human genome project. Today,
we have genome projects for hundreds of different non-model and agricultural species. Most of
these teams consist of a handful of researchers who are dedicated to knowing more about frogs,
alligators, falcons, hedgehogs, gorillas, bats, walrus's, beetles, and yes, horses<sup>[6](#6)</sup>. 
Luckily, computers have made most the the process in drafting a reference genome 
a streamlined process. However, there are still some things computers are just
not good at recognizing or resolving.
