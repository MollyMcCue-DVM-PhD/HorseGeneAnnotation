# HorseGeneAnnotation
Welcome! This is the README file for HorseGeneAnnotation: a manually curated,
crowd-sourced gene annotation website for the horse. This repo contains all of
the source code, documentations, tutorials and project tracking for
HorseGeneAnnotation.

# To study genomics you need a genome
Genetics studies how changes in DNA changes can affect a living organism. Similarly,
genomics investigates the entirety of an organisms DNA-sequence -- its genome. Since
everyone, except twins and clones, have a different genome, it can be hard to 
organize experiments. Researchers studying genetics and genomics collectively
rely on a reference genome in order to make comparisons. This way, when a scientist
finds what they think is a change in the DNA, or a mutation, they can compare it to the reference 
genome in order to design experiments. 

Generating a reference genome costs a lot of money -- but it is getting better. 
The cost to sequence the first human genome was nearly 3 billion[1](#ref1)
dollars! Due to rapid advances in technology and an emerging biomedical market,
a genome today only takes ~$1000 dollars to sequence[2](#ref2). This is a pretty
good deal considering that the human genome is composed of nearly 3.2 billion
base pairs, the unit of information in DNA[3](#ref3). This advance in technology
has also enabled reasearchers and scientists who study other genetics in other
organisms to draft and assemble their own genome. In 2009, less than a decade 
after the human genome was completed, the nearly 2.7 billion base pairs of the 
equine genome were sequenced and made available to the public[4](#ref4).
